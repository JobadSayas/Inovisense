# Inovisense - Smart device management platform

## Project Description

Inovisense was developed as a solution for managing and administrating a fleet of IoT devices, primarily in a school environment. It provides a streamlined interface for monitoring device statuses, managing locations and users, and configuring notifications based on device parameters. Designed to simplify smart device monitoring, it enables administrators to efficiently manage and troubleshoot devices in real time. 

This project was built using **React** for the UI components and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, with additional features to support user interactivity. API integration and backend support were handled by a separate developer, allowing seamless interaction with device data and configurations.

## Features

- **Device Management**: View device statuses, add new devices, modify existing device information, and remove devices as necessary.
- **Configurable Notifications**: Set up alerts and notifications based on device parameters to receive timely updates about the status and condition of devices.
- **Location Management**: Organize and manage device locations to easily locate and track devices within the system.
- **User Management**: Add and manage users with roles and permissions tailored to their access needs.
- **Real-time Status Monitoring**: Get immediate feedback on the operational status of each device to quickly address any issues.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Framework for building the UI components and interactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for streamlined and responsive styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core language used for functionality and logic.
